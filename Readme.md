# G2 - Trajectory tracking with mobile robots
Project for course TEK4030 at University of Oslo. Goal is to implement a trajectory tracking algorithm for ROS turtlebot, using algorithms from chapter 11 in Robotics Modelling, Planning and Control by Siciliano et al. 

Turtlebot was simulated in gazebo using https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#simulate-in-various-world. Although I mainly used http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot3_fake and http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_teleop/Tutorials/Keyboard%20Teleop for manual control. 



### Path Planning
from chapter 11.5.3 Path Planning in the book ???
the "Planning via Cartesian polynomials " cubic polynomial method was implemented. 

### Timing Law for the trajectory
To make the path into a trajectory a timing law is needed. From chapter "11.5.4 Trajectory Planning" a timing law should have been implemented. NOT DONE YET. VERY CONFUSED O___O

### Trajectory tracking
From chapter "11.6.1 Trajectory Tracking" a control algorithm was implemented. ??? (also confused about this part)
